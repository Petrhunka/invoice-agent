# Logo Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the Keboola logo.

## To add the logo:

1. Place your `logo_blue.png` file in this directory (project root)
   - Recommended size: 150-200px width
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - Color scheme: Keboola blue (#1F8FFF)

2. Uncomment the logo code in `main_simple.py`:

   **Sidebar logo (around line 46):**
   ```python
   st.image("logo_blue.png", width=150)
   ```

   **Header logo (around lines 98-100):**
   ```python
   with open("logo_blue.png", "rb") as f:
       logo_data = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode()
   st.markdown(render_header_with_logo(logo_data), unsafe_allow_html=True)
   ```

3. The app will work perfectly fine without the logo - it's purely cosmetic.

## Current State

The application is fully functional without the logo. All placeholder comments are in place
for easy integration when the logo file becomes available.
